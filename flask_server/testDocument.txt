Osmosis is the movement of a solvent across a semipermeable membrane toward a higher concentration of solute. In biological systems, the solvent is typically water, but osmosis can occur in other liquids, supercritical liquids, and even gases.
When a cell is submerged in water, the water molecules pass through the cell membrane from an area of low solute concentration to high solute concentration. For example, if the cell is submerged in saltwater, water molecules move out of the cell. If a cell is submerged in freshwater, water molecules move into the cell.

Raja-Yoga is divided into eight steps, the first is Yama -- non - killing, truthfulness, non - stealing, continence, and non - receiving of any gifts.
Next is Niyama -- cleanliness, contentment, austerity, study, and self - surrender to God.
